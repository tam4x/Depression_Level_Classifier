    - Used 3 different Neural Network Models
        - Simple Architecture with RELU as activation Function
        - Complexer Architecture with RELU activation Function
        - Complexer Architecture with tanh activation Function
    - performed hyperparameter to get the best model, learning rate, optimizer and optional momentum
    - Same procedure for adaboost where I used the depth, number of trees and learning rate for hyperparameter tuning
    - after i got the best parameters for the models i trained them for longer on more iterations to get a better result

    - Results
        - Confusion Matrices
        - ROC Curves
        - Metrics can be found under Results/Metrics.csv
